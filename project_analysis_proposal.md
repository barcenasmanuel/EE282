# Project Analysis Proposal

Single-cell sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to observe cell fate trajectories, providing new insights into gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and their roles in cellular processes. Previously, our lab utilized pseudotime as a cell ordering method to study GRNs in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) cell lineages (Barcenas M et al., May 2024). Understanding cell types and their fate trajectories in the kidney is crucial for developing treatments for kidney-related diseases, ultimately leading to more effective interventions and improved patient outcomes.

This project aims to leverage our established analysis pipeline to explore a publicly available dataset of murine kidneys following ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (Gaedcke S et al., July 2022). The dataset, accessible on the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO Accession ID: GSE193649), includes single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data. It comprises a control group and samples collected at 17 and 27 minutes post-IR injury, offering a comprehensive view of cellular responses at various injury stages. According to the authors, the scRNA-seq data includes 20,291 cells, with the highest cell count of 10,647 from the 17-minute IR injury. The snRNA-seq data comprises 12,301 nuclei, with a peak count of 4,627 nuclei from the same time point as the scRNA-seq.

The analysis will involve several key steps to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the data. Initially, I will preprocess the scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data using the Scanpy library in Python, including normalization, filtering, and quality control to ensure reliable results. Following this, I will employ UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction, facilitating visualization and interpretation of cell clusters and trajectories. Pseudotime analysis will be performed using the scVelo library in Python to reconstruct cellular trajectories over time, helping to identify how cell states evolve following IR injury. Additionally, community detection algorithms, such as Girvan-Newman and Greedy Modularity from the Networkx library in Python, will be used to identify the number of communities as they change along the pseudotime of the cell datasets for each modality (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq).

To support these analyses, several visualizations will be created. UMAP plots will visualize cell clusters and relationships, aiding in the identification of distinct cell populations. Eigenvalue plots will provide insights into the stability of cell states as they evolve with pseudotime. Pseudotime trajectories will be visualized to observe the progression of cell states over time, with a focus on top genes. Additionally, plots will be created to show the number of communities as they change with pseudotime. All visualizations will be generated using Scanpy, scVelo, and Matplotlib in Python, ensuring clarity and reproducibility.

This analysis is feasible within the given timeframe and scope. The dataset is readily accessible, and the proposed methods are well-supported by existing tools and resources. By focusing on specific, manageable analyses, the project aligns with course objectives and leverages skills developed throughout the class. The necessary packages are available for download and should not pose installation issues in an Anaconda environment on HPC3. If challenges arise with the snRNA-seq datasets, we will default to using the scRNA-seq datasets, as our pipeline is known to work with them. The integration of exploratory data analysis and visualization ensures that the research remains both comprehensive and focused, providing meaningful insights into kidney injury mechanisms.

In conclusion, this analysis proposal outlines a clear and feasible strategy for investigating cell fate trajectories in murine kidneys post-IR injury. By utilizing advanced bioinformatics techniques and focusing on specific analyses and visualizations, the project promises to enhance our understanding of cellular responses in kidney injury. This work aligns with my research goals of studying cell state stability and has the potential to contribute to the development of targeted therapies for kidney-related diseases by elucidating how GRNs evolve with pseudotime.
